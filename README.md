# 8-bit Harvard Pipelined RISC Processor

## Features
- 8-bit data calculations
- Harvard architecture
- Pipelining for improved performance
- Flexibility for various instruction sets

## Components
- **ALU**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations
- **Registers**: Store data temporarily during processing
- **Control Unit**: Directs operation of the processor

## Operation Cycle
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve instruction from memory
2. **Decode**: Interpret the instruction
3. **Execute**: Carry out the instruction
4. **Write Back**: Store the result in memory

## Benefits
- Enhanced processing speed due to pipelining
- Efficient data handling with Harvard architecture
- Scalable to more complex designs

## Future Work
- Expanding instruction set
- Improving power efficiency
- Implementing error correction features

## Conclusion
The 8-bit Harvard Pipelined RISC Processor is a robust design for efficient data processing tasks. Further iterations may enhance its capabilities even more.
